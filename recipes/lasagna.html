        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> 1 1/2 pounds ground beef</li>
            <li>30 oz Marinara Sauce</li>
            <li>3/4 cup of water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>16 oz package of cottage cheese</li>
            <li>12 oz grated mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated parmesean cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the ground beef in a large saucepan over medium-high heat until browned and no longer pink, about 5 minutes; drain fat. Stir in the marinara sauce, water, and salt. Bring to a boil. Remove sauce from heat.</li>
            <li>Arrange 6 noodles in a 9x13-inch baking dish, breaking if necessary to fit. Spoon 1/2 of the sauce over noodles. Top with 1/2 of the cottage cheese and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers with remaining noodles, sauce, cottage cheese, and mozzarella cheese. Top with Parmesan cheese. Cover tightly with foil; refrigerate overnight.</li>
            <li>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Bake lasagna, covered, until noodles are soft, cheese is melted, and sauce is bubbly, about 1 hour. Allow to sit for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
